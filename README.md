This repo contains code related to the KPI Monitoring Xapp.
Main source code for the xapp is under src/

Look at Dockerfile for building instructions


NOTE : In order to compile code as a stand alone process, following pre-requisites are required 
-- For compilation, the nanomsg, nng and ric messaging libraries, as well as ric messaging header must be installed in standard paths (or if non-default, then visible in search paths)

-- mdclog library and headers must be installed and available in search path

-- hiredis library and headers must be installed and available in search path

The run_xapp.sh script provides a convenient way to set the various parameters and invoke the process (if not running in a docker container)
